# DogBot

DogBot is a Python project focused on the kinematics of a quadruped robot. The project includes scripts for simulating and plotting the robot's movements using matplotlib.

## Features

- **DH Parameters**: Define the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for the robot.
- **Leg Inverse Kinematics**: Compute the leg positions for various movements.
- **Movement Patterns**: Includes functions for hopping, pushups, and sit-stand transitions.
- **Visualization**: Plot and simulate the robot's movements using matplotlib.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iCaran/DogBot.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main scripts to see the different movement patterns and kinematics simulations:
```bash
python main.py
```
